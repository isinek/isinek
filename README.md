<summary><h3>My story</h3></summary>
<p align="justify">
It all started on May 1st 1993., in the small yet charming town of Bjelovar, Croatia. As a child, I was always curious
and loved to take apart toys, especially if they had motors inside. I would spend countless hours tinkering with LEGO
blocks, gluing motors to them, and sending them down the stairs with an improvised parachute or crashing them into
walls.

When I was 12 years old, our informatics teacher showed us a small robotic arm that he programmed himself. From that day
on, I knew I wanted to learn how to program everything. The following spring, I started learning QBasic and simple
algorithms, and there was no turning back after that.

In high school, I continued to learn C and C++ and honed my problem-solving skills. In 2012, after seven years of
competing, I participated in the national competition in computer science. Alongside programming, I also learned as much
as I could about mathematics, electronics, and physics.

As mathematics and programming were my strong suits, I began studying computer science at the Polytechnic of Zagreb
in 2012. After completing my first year of college, I started working as a web developer, then a PHP developer, and
later as a .NET developer and professor's assistant. Eventually, I returned to my roots as a C programmer. During this
time, I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees.

After all these years, I still enjoy programming competitions, problem-solving, and tearing everything apart and putting
it back together. If the day had 60 hours instead of 24, I'm not sure if that would be enough time to complete all the
DIY projects, learn new skills, and solve all the fun problems I'd like to solve.
