	<summary><h3>My Story</h3></summary>

It all started on May 1st 1993., in the small yet charming town of Bjelovar, Croatia. As a child, I was always curious
and loved to take apart toys, especially if they had motors inside. I would spend countless hours tinkering with LEGO
blocks, gluing motors to them, and sending them down the stairs with an improvised parachute or crashing them into
walls.

When I was 12 years old, our informatics teacher showed us a small robotic arm that he programmed himself. From that day
on, I knew I wanted to learn how to program everything. The following spring, I started learning QBasic and simple
algorithms, and there was no turning back after that.

In high school, I continued to learn C and C++ and honed my problem-solving skills. In 2012, after seven years of
competing, I participated in the national competition in computer science. Alongside programming, I also learned as much
as I could about mathematics, electronics, and physics.

As mathematics and programming were my strong suits, I began studying computer science at the Polytechnic of Zagreb in
2012. After completing my first year of college, I started working as a web developer, then a PHP developer, and later
as a .NET developer and professor's assistant. Eventually, I returned to my roots as a C programmer. During this time,
I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees.

After all these years, I still enjoy programming competitions, problem-solving, and tearing everything apart and putting
it back together. If the day had 60 hours instead of 24, I'm not sure if that would be enough time to complete all the
DIY projects, learn new skills, and solve all the fun problems I'd like to solve.

	<summary><h3>Business Journey</h3></summary>

#### Business Computer Systems
During my high school internship, I spent almost three years learning about the maintenance and repair of computers and
computer equipment.

#### Cesar informatika d.o.o.
This was my first job as a programmer. My primary responsibility was adding features to existing web applications. One
of my favorite projects was the Grader for Polytechnic of Zagreb. It was an interesting project that involved a database
of programming tasks, an online compiler, solution testing, and source code comparator.

#### BoatBooker
At BoatBooker, a small company with a big international product, I learned a lot about web development, PHP, and the
Drupal framework. My responsibilities included almost everything related to customer websites, such as integrating
widgets, creating HTML newsletters, designing CMS, and teaching customers how to use them.

#### [KING ICT](https://king-ict.com/)
KING ICT is where I matured professionally. I earned my spot in the company by winning the CodeChallenge student
competition in 2015. While there, I learned the importance of good colleagues and work ethics. I mastered .NET, SQL
server, release management, continuous integration, and scrum. During my time there, I earned several Microsoft
certificates, worked on multiple enterprise projects, and initiated several programming educations and competitions.

#### [Ericsson Nikola Tesla](https://www.ericsson.hr/en/)
After working in web technologies for several years, I had the opportunity to work with hardware that would be used all
over the world at Ericsson Nikola Tesla. Here, I learned a lot about Linux, bash, Python, GIT, hardware, and polished my
knowledge of C. Most of my time at Ericsson Nikola Tesla was spent working on the latest products with teams in Sweden.
Depending on the team, I worked in various roles, including developer, technical team lead, and product guardian.
